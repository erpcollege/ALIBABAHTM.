WHAT IS ALIBABA?
Alibaba's e-commerce platforms cater to both Chinese and global consumers, though the majority of its transactions are generated domestically.

WHO'S BEHIND THE COMPANY?
Alibaba was founded in the living room of Jack Ma, a former English teacher. A self-made billionaire, Ma is a folk hero to some Chinese.

Some brands complain about how slow and difficult it is to get fakes removed from Alibaba's sites. Alibaba says it has spent tens of millions of dollars on anti-counterfeiting and that it is constantly trying to improve its systems.

WHERE'S THE NAME FROM?
Ma wanted a name people around the world would recognize. He asked a waitress in a San Francisco restaurant if she recognized the name Alibaba and she said, "Yes, open sesame!" Drawn from "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves," the name stuck
